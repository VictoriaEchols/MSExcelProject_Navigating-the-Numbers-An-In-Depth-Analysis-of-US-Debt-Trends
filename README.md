## Background

In this project, I dive into the complex and critical topic of the United States' national debt, employing Excel to dissect and visualize the data across various dimensions. The goal was to create an accessible, yet comprehensive, overview of US debt trends over time, examining factors such as total debt amounts, debt as a percentage of GDP, and key contributors to debt growth. By leveraging Excel's powerful data analysis and visualization tools, I aimed to offer insights into how the US debt has evolved and what it might mean for the future.

## Questions

This analysis was guided by several pivotal questions:
- How has the total US debt changed over the past decades?
- What trends can be observed in debt as a percentage of GDP, and what do they indicate about the economy's health?
- Which factors have contributed most significantly to the increase in US debt?

## Main Findings

The exploration into US debt data revealed several noteworthy insights:
- **Debt Growth**: There has been a marked increase in the total US debt over time, with significant spikes associated with economic recessions and major policy changes.
- **Debt vs. GDP**: The debt-to-GDP ratio has reached historically high levels in recent years, signaling potential concerns for economic stability.
- **Contributing Factors**: Key drivers of debt growth include entitlement program expenditures, defense spending, and the impacts of tax policy changes.

## Conclusions

The analysis of US debt through Excel provided a nuanced view of the nation's fiscal health and the underlying factors contributing to its debt trajectory. Understanding these trends is crucial for policymakers, economists, and the public to navigate the challenges of fiscal responsibility and economic stability. This project underscores the importance of transparent, data-driven discussions around national debt and its implications for future generations.

## Process

The project involved several critical steps executed within Excel:
1. **Data Compilation**: Aggregating US debt data from various official sources into a comprehensive Excel dataset.
